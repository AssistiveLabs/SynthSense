### Obstacle Avoidance

Navigating to a completely unfamiliar surrounding is already difficult, itâ€™s also a challenge to avoid obstacles on the way to a destination. The main issues are

#### Sidewalk Crack Detection
  - Cracks are really hard to notice. An uneven road surface can easily trip anyone. Moreover, canes can get stuck in a crack and break. No current cane system we could find detects this. Our alert system will alert the user before such situations occur. 
#### Overhead Obstacles
  - Low hanging tree branches are hard to detect because the normal assistive device only detects ground level objects. Current systems allow for this. We intend to integrate it into our device.
#### Thin objects
  - Objects such as flag poles  and tree trunks are very easy to miss due to how skinny they are.

#### Possible Solutions
- Augment the white cane
- Delivers feedback on objects above ground-level
- Magnetometer + multiple distance sensors (TBD)
